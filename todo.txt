"""Objectives:
[-] Store key-value pairs in a dictionary
[-] Implement TTL (Time To Live) functionality for cache entries
[-] Remove expired entries automatically
[-] Provide methods to get, set, and delete cache entries
[-] Implement a method to print the current state of the cache
[-] Convert the code into a class-based structure for better organization
[-] Implement a method to get the current size of the cache
[-] Implement a method to cleanup the expired entries in the cache
[-] Background cleanup to handle expired items automatically.
[-] Implement LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction for cache size management.
[-] Implement pluggable eviction policies (Strategy Pattern).
[-] Ensure thread safety for concurrent access.
[-] Enhance expiry strategies to allow more flexibility.
[-] Make the cache entry and cache response more clear, e.g., using a dataclass or namedtuple.
[-] Make the cache persistent to survive application restarts.
[-] Implement pluggable serialization formats (e.g., JSON, Pickle).
[-] Implement a system to track the metrics 
[-] Convert the calculated metrics to properties and add them in snapshot
[-] Create a defaults or config file for the cache
[-] Bulk operation functions, set() function for upsurt
[] Save the metrics snapshot to a json file on disk everytime cleanup() function is called
[] Make JSON Serializer and also a asdict function for cache entry
[] Save metrics to file functions
[] Add Logging
[] Take care of zombie threads on application exit.
[] Add Custom exceptions
